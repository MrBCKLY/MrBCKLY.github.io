# retrieval.education

This website is a revision tool for anyone studying computer science, but will be most useful for those studying the GCSE and A-Level AQA specifications.

**What does it do?**

It creates and marks theory questions. It covers a wide range of topics, the user can determine which topics should be included in each session. 

**Why does it exist?**

I am a computer science teacher and I am currently attempting to embed more retrieval practice into my own teaching. Rather than create hundreds of questions and answers myself I realised that I could use the very subject that I am teaching about to do it for me. This also had the added benefit of allowing me to share this with others, which is this website.

**Anything else?**
You can follow me on twitter @MrBCKLY if you have any further questions.
